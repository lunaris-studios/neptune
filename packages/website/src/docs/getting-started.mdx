<!-- Nucleus is a Component Library built on top of [Nucleus System](/docs/nucleus-system). -->

### Installing Nucleus

Nucleus is currently under heavy development, but can be installed by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @nucleus/core
```

<br />
or

```
yarn add @nucleus/core
```

### Nucleus Provider

Make sure to wrap your app in `NucleusProvider` to get the default theme:

```js
import { NucleusProvider } from '@nucleus/core';

const App = () => <NucleusProvider>Hey thereðŸ‘‹</NucleusProvider>;
```

### Importing components from Nucleus

All components can be imported directly:

```js
import { Heading, Text, Link } from '@nucleus/core';
```
