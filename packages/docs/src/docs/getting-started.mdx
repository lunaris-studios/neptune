<!-- Neptune is a Component Library built on top of [Neptune System](/docs/neptune-system). -->

### Installing Neptune

Neptune is currently under heavy development, but can be installed by running either of these commands:

```
npm install @neptune/core
```

<br />
or

```
yarn add @neptune/core
```

### Neptune Provider

Make sure to wrap your app in `NeptuneProvider` to get the default theme:

```js
import { NeptuneProvider } from '@neptune/core';

const App = () => <NeptuneProvider>Hey thereðŸ‘‹</NeptuneProvider>;
```

### Importing components from Neptune

All components can be imported directly:

```js
import { Heading, Text, Link } from '@neptune/core';
```
